### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently pursuing a Ph.D. focused on enhancing privacy for digital identities, I come from a solid background with a Master's degree in Cyber Security and experience founding a startup. If you're interested in discussing or collaborating on topics such as decentralized identities or verifiable credentials, especially in how we can deliver these with exceptional user experience and security, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
